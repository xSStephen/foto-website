#A README.md file, for me to talk about philosophy.

This is just a little project made in vanilla HTML & CSS.

I'm doing this almost useless project not because I can't do more, but because I don't have the time with my current job to work at something more meaningful, and to think about not doing anythimg is terrible.

Project instructions:

<!-- Responsive, mobile first -->

1. Navbar:
   - 3-4 buttons;
   - logo on left and buttons on right;
   - smoothscroll to sections;
2. Main section:
   - A background;
   - A Carousel with a few images;
3. Price section:
   - 3 sections with packages made in grid;
   - on hover, the grid items will zoom out a little;
4. Footer:
   - useful links;
   - copyright;

#DEPRECATED (for now)
